Title: Safe Bayesian Regression Model Selection with E-Values
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("SafeBRMS", "Contributors", email = "safebrms@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements safe Bayesian regression model selection using brms models 
    with Turner/Ly/Grunwald e-variable constructions. Provides per-observation 
    exponential-family GLM likelihood ratio based e-variables with mixing to ensure 
    E <= 1 under the null hypothesis. Computes coefficient e-values and e-posteriors 
    over theta grids. Includes support for multiple testing correction using 
    Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
